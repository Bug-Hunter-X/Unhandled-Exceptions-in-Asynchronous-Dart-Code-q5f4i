This example demonstrates a common error in Dart: insufficient error handling in asynchronous operations. The `fetchData` function makes an HTTP request but doesn't thoroughly handle potential errors.  The solution shows how to improve error handling by checking the response status code and using a `try-catch` block to handle exceptions gracefully.  Proper error handling is crucial for robust and reliable Dart applications.
